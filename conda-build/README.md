### Building for macOS

Install conda packages as described here ```conda-build/common/install_conda.sh``` and run ```conda create --name py39 python=3.9 -y;conda activate py39```.
Running ```python matrix_builder.py``` with python >= 3.10 will start the build process by setting all the environment variables and making a call to conda build. Make sure the meta.yaml file in conda-build/habitat-sim/ is configured correctly according to https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html

Once the package is built, make sure you're logged in to anaconda cloud and then run ```anaconda upload <path to the tarball file that conda build created>```. For example ```anaconda upload hsim-macos/osx-64/habitat-sim-1.3.2-py3.9_osx.tar.bz2```. This will upload the package to anaconda cloud for everyone to download.

To then download the package, run ```conda install -c aihabitat -c conda-forge habitat-sim```.


### Building for Linux

The process is almost the same for linux; there is a corresponding python script for starting things off, however we use a docker container to do the builds. There is a dockerfile in this directory that you can use to create a container.

```docker build -t hsim_condabuild_dcontainer -f Dockerfile .```

That will create your docker container. Now run

```docker run -it --ipc=host --rm -v $(pwd)/../:/remote hsim_condabuild_dcontainer bash```

From there you will have a shell within your linux container. Now, navigate to ```cd /remote/conda-build``` where habitat-sim has been mounted. Create a conda environment within the linux container with python>=3.9 (identical to that needed by habitat-sim build): ```conda create --name py39 python=3.9;conda activate py39```. And then run ```python matrix_builder.py```, which will kick off the build process. After this has finished, upload it to anaconda cloud in the same way described in the macOS section.

To download the package, run ```conda install -c aihabitat -c conda-forge habitat-sim headless ```.

Our linux conda builds currently only support ```{head / headless} x {with bullet / without bullet}``` binaries. In the command above, we are telling conda to use a feature called ```headless```.



### Notes

* If building from your normal development clone of the repo, make sure to remove your build folder, i.e. ```rm -r ../build```.  The builder will copy that folder and cmake will error out otherwise.

* You don't need to create a fresh conda env for building.  Just installing ```conda-build=3.18.9``` in any existing conda env (with python >= 3.9) is sufficient.

* You can upload all the binaries with one command by running ```find . -name "*.tar.bz2" | xargs -I {} anaconda upload {}``` in this folder.
