# Find Bullet
# -----------
#
# Finds the Bullet libraries. This module defines:
#
#  Bullet_FOUND         - True if Bullet is found
#  Bullet::Dynamics     - Bullet Dynamics imported target. Depends on
#   Bullet::Collision and Bullet::LinearMath.
#  Bullet::Collision    - Bullet Collision imported target. Depends on
#   Bullet::LinearMath.
#  Bullet::LinearMath   - Bullet Linear Math imported target
#  Bullet::SoftBody     - Bullet Soft Body imported target. Depends on
#   Bullet::Dynamics, Bullet::Collision and Bullet::LinearMath.
#
# Additionally these variables are defined for internal usage:
#
#  Bullet_Dynamics_LIBRARY_{DEBUG,RELEASE} - Bullet Dynamics library location
#  Bullet_Collision_LIBRARY_{DEBUG,RELEASE} - Bullet Collision library location
#  Bullet_LinearMath_LIBRARY_{DEBUG,RELEASE} - Bullet Linear Math library
#   location
#  Bullet_SoftBody_LIBRARY_{DEBUG,RELEASE} - Bullet SoftBody library location
#  Bullet_INCLUDE_DIR   - Include dir

# In case we have Bullet as a CMake subproject, BulletCollision should be
# defined (as opposed to Bullet3Common, which can be disabled with
# BUILD_BULLET3). If it's not, try to find the Bullet config file -- under
# Vcpkg at least, it defines imported targets that we can use. Vanilla Bullet
# also installs a config file, however that file is rather unhelpful since it
# doesn't expose any imported targets that I could rely on. And instead of
# extracting everything out of BULLET_LIBRARIES I'd rather just search for it
# myself.

    # correctly, causing linker errors on our side. If we're on CMake 3.13, we
    # can fix that from outside, otherwise unfortunately bad luck.
    # TODO: this will probably blow up in Vcpkg as well, the patch there should
    #   get expanded to remove the if(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS) around
    #   target_link_libraries(). Ideally, such patch should be pushed to Bullet
