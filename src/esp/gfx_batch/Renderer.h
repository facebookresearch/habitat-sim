@brief Batch renderer

A renderer optimized for drawing multiple scenes at once, applying multi-draw
optimizations where possible to reduce draw overhead. While all scenes are
rendered at once, each scene contains an independent set of rendered objects.

This class expects an active @ref Magnum::GL::Context and renders into a
provided framebuffer, making it suitable for use in GUI applications. For
standalone operation use the @ref RendererStandalone subclass instead, which
manages the OpenGL context and a framebuffer on its own. Apart from the context
and framebuffer, the high-level usage is same for both.

@section gfx_batch-Renderer-terms Terms used

- **Model file** is a regular glTF, OBJ, PLY, ... model, with no restrictions
  on its contents. The whole file is treated as a single *node heirarchy*.
- **Composite file** is a set of regular *model files* brought together into a
  single file with various optimizations applied. Often it's a single
  *composite mesh* together with a single *composite texture*. The original
  model files form *node hierarchies* in the composite file and are referenced
  using string identifiers.
- **Node hierarchy** is a hierarchy of nodes with meshes, materials or lights
  attached. It's referenced using a string identifier in a *composite file*,
  using a filename in a  model and using a numeric ID when added to a *scene*.
- **Scene** is a set of *node hierarchies* added either from *model files* or
  *composite files*. A single scene can appear in multiple *batch cameras*,
  rendered by multiple *cameras*.
- **Batch camera** has a framebuffer with various *batch camera outputs*
  attached and renders a grid of *scenes* assigned to it. All tiles in the grid
  have the same size and each is a single *camera*.
- **Batch camera output** is a color, depth or semantic buffer to which a
  *batch camera* renders.
- **Camera** is what a *batch camera* uses to render a particular *scene*. Its
  output size is given by the *batch camera* tile size, contains a projection
  and a transformation matrix and a mask of *node hierarchies* that it should
  render from given *scene*.

@section gfx_batch-Renderer-usage Usage

The renderer gets constructed using a @ref RendererConfiguration with desired
tile size and count set via @ref RendererConfiguration::setTileSizeCount() as
described in its documentation. Each tile corresponds to one rendered scene,
organized in a grid, all scenes have the same rendered size.

First, files with meshes, materials and textures that are meant to be rendered
from should get added via @ref addFile(). The file itself isn't directly
rendered, instead it's treated as a *composite file* with named root scene
nodes being *node hierarchy templates* to be selectively added to particular
scenes. Apart from picking particular root nodes, it's also possible to treat
the whole file as a single hierarchy using @ref RendererFileFlag::Whole. See
the flag documentation for more information.

@m_class{m-note m-warning}

@par
  All needed files should be added upfront, before populating the scenes or
  drawing anything. This is currently not enforced in any way, but is subject
  to change.

Then, particular scenes are populated using @ref addNodeHierarchy(),
referencing the node hierarchy templates via their names. The function takes an
initial transformation and returns an ID of the node added into the scene. The
ID can then be used to subsequently update its transformation via
@ref transformations(), for example in respose to a physics simulation or an
animation. Each scene also has an associated camera and its combined projection
and transformation matrix can be updated using @ref updateCamera().

Finally, the @ref draw() function renders the grid of scenes into a provided
framebuffer.

@section gfx_batch-Renderer-workflow Inner workflow of the batch renderer

The goal of the renderer is to do as much as possible using the least amount of
draw calls. For that, it relies heavily on multi-draw and texture array support
implemented in @ref shaders-usage-multidraw "Magnum shaders".

- At the beginning, all data from files added by @ref addFile() get uploaded to
  the GPU. The data consists of meshes, texture image levels and packed
  material uniforms. Such data are uploaded only once and treated as immutable
  for the rest of the renderer lifetime.
- On each @ref addNodeHierarchy() call, a list of mesh views each together with
  material association, texture layer and transform and node assignment is
  added to a *draw list*. The draw list is
  @ref gfx_batch-Renderer-workflow-draw-list "further detailed below".
- For each @ref draw() and each non-empty scene, the following is done:
  - The transformation passed to @ref updateCamera() is uploaded to a uniform buffer.
  - The renderer calculates hierarchical transformations for all nodes based on
    the matrices supplied via @ref transformations(). Each item in the draw
    list is then assigned a corresponding calculated absolute transformation,
    and the list of transformations corresponding to all draws is uploaded to a
    uniform buffer.
  - Then the draw list is processed, resulting in one or more multi-draw calls
    @ref gfx_batch-Renderer-workflow-draw-list "as described below".

@subsection gfx_batch-Renderer-workflow-draw-list Draw list and multi-draw call submission

In the ideal (and often impossible) case, there would be just a single file
added with @ref addFile(), containing exactly one mesh and exactly one texture
array, with scene nodes referring to sub-views of them --- i.e., mesh index
ranges, texture layer indices and texture transformation matrices. Then, no
matter how many times @ref addNodeHierarchy() gets called, the whole draw list
populated by it can be drawn with a single multi-draw call.

@m_class{m-note m-info}

@par
  When @ref sceneStats() would be retrieved for such a case,
  @ref SceneStats::nodeCount and @ref SceneStats::drawCount would be both high
  numbers, while @ref SceneStats::drawBatchCount would be exactly @cpp 1 @ce.

In practice however, the files may contain meshes with different vertex layouts
(such as some having vertex colors and some not), textures of different formats
and sizes, and different materials requiring different shaders (such as
vertex-colored, alpha-masked etc.). Draw lists populated with
@ref addNodeHierarchy() are then partitioned into *draw batches*, where a
particular draw batch contains all draws with a particular shader, from a
particular mesh and with a particular texture. Each draw batch then corresponds
to a single multi-draw call issued on the GPU.

@subsection gfx_batch-Renderer-workflow-tradeoffs Performance tradeoffs

The optimization goal here is to pick a balance between minimizing driver
overhead from submitting many draw calls and paying extra cost for shader
features, texture fetches and vertex attributes present also for draws that
don't need them.

@m_class{m-note m-info}

@par
  In other words, trying to maximize the ratio of @ref SceneStats::drawCount
  and @ref SceneStats::drawBatchCount for as long as CPU usage gets lower but
  GPU usage doesn't get higher.

For example, if only some meshes use vertex colors, it's possible to add white
vertex colors to the remaining meshes, unifying their layout and making it
possible to draw them together in a single draw call. The cost of extra vertex
processing bandwidth would probably be rather minimal. On the other hand, if
some materials need alpha masking and some not, attempting to draw everything
with alpha masking enabled may have a much larger cost than the additional draw
call saved by this change.

Here it's important to also take into account differences on the web --- there
the driver overhead is significantly higher and it might be beneficial to put
extra effort into reducing draw batch count even though it may result in
slightly worse performance natively.

@section gfx_batch-Renderer-files Creating batch-optimized files

While @ref addFile() can consume any count of any regular scene/model files
@ref file-formats "supported by Magnum", in order to properly take advantage of
all performance features it's needed to combine the files into batch-optimized
* *composite files* containing mesh views and texture arrays.

Batch-optimized files can be stored in any file format that has sufficient
flexibility for @ref Magnum::Trade::MeshData layouts, is capable of storing 2D
array textures and supports storing custom @ref Magnum::Trade::SceneData
fields. At the moment, a file format supporting all this is glTF, with files
produced using the @relativeref{Magnum::Trade,GltfSceneConverter} plugin.

@m_class{m-note m-info}

@par
  For an overview of how a fully manual process of creating a batch-optimized
  glTF file looks like, have a look at the `generateTestData()` function in the
  [GfxBatchRendererTest.cpp](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/blob/main/src/tests/GfxBatchRendererTest.cpp)
  file. Practical cases of dataset conversion would be more focused on reusing
  and combining data imported from other files instead of creating them from
  scratch, but the overall process is similar.

@subsection gfx_batch-Renderer-files-meshes Meshes and mesh views

* *Composite meshes*, which concatenate several meshes of the same layout
together, can be added with the general
@ref Magnum::Trade::AbstractSceneConverter::add(const MeshData&, Containers::StringView)
API and referenced from scene nodes via @ref Magnum::Trade::SceneField::Mesh.
* *Mesh views*, referencing sub-ranges of the composite mesh, aren't a builtin
@ref Magnum::Trade::SceneData feature at the moment however, and thus have to
be added as @ref Trade-SceneData-populating-custom "custom scene fields" of the
following names:

- `meshViewIndexOffset` of type @ref Magnum::Trade::SceneFieldType::UnsignedInt,
  containing offset of the mesh view in the index buffer *in bytes*,
- `meshViewIndexCount` of type @ref Magnum::Trade::SceneFieldType::UnsignedInt,
  containing index count, and
- `meshViewMaterial` of type @ref Magnum::Trade::SceneFieldType::Int containing
  the corresponding material ID. The builtin
  @ref Magnum::Trade::SceneField::MeshMaterial is not used, because glTF bakes
  the material reference into the mesh itself, which means referencing the same
  mesh multiple times with different materials would cause it to be
  unnecessarily duplicated in the glTF.

The custom field IDs can be arbitrary, what's important is that they are
associated with corresponding names using
@ref Magnum::Trade::AbstractSceneConverter::setSceneFieldName(). Furthermore,
to prevent the file from being opened by unsuspecting glTF viewers, a private
`MAGNUMX_mesh_views` extension should be added as both
@cb{.ini} extensionUsed @ce and @cb{.ini} extensionRequired @ce in the
@ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "plugin configuration". Inspecting
the resulting file with @ref magnum-sceneconverter "magnum-sceneconverter" may
look similarly to this:

@m_class{m-console-figure}

@parblock

@code{.sh}
magnum-sceneconverter --info-scenes -i ignoreRequiredExtensions batch.gltf
@endcode

<b><!-- don't remove, Doxygen workaround --></b>

@m_class{m-nopad}

@include gfx-batch-info-scenes.ansi

@endparblock

<b><!-- don't remove, Doxygen workaround --></b>

@m_class{m-note m-info}

@par
  This implementation of mesh views is a temporary solution. Eventually mesh
  views will become a builtin Magnum feature, being implicitly encoded in glTF
  accessor properties in a way that's compatible with 3rd party glTF tools as
  well.

<b><!-- don't remove, Doxygen workaround --></b>

@m_class{m-note m-success}

@par
  Meshes can be concatenated together for example using
  @ref Magnum::MeshTools::concatenate().

@subsection gfx_batch-Renderer-files-textures Texture arrays

For 2D texture arrays the
[KHR_texture_ktx](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1964) extension is
used. Because it's not approved by Khronos yet, it needs the
@cb{.ini} experimentalKhrTextureKtx @ce
@ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option"
enabled in the converter plugin. Materials should reference layers of it via
@ref Magnum::Trade::MaterialAttribute::BaseColorTextureLayer and related
attributes, together with supplying
@relativeref{Magnum::Trade::MaterialAttribute,BaseColorTextureMatrix}
describing a sub-image of a particular layer. Inspecting the resulting file
with @ref magnum-sceneconverter "magnum-sceneconverter" may look similarly to
this:

@m_class{m-console-figure}

@parblock

@m_class{m-console-wrap}

@code{.sh}
magnum-sceneconverter --info-textures --info-images --info-materials \
  -i experimentalKhrTextureKtx,ignoreRequiredExtensions batch.gltf
@endcode

<b></b>

@m_class{m-nopad}

@include gfx-batch-info-textures.ansi

@endparblock

@m_class{m-note m-success}

@par
  2D textures with power-of-two sizes can be atlased into a texture array for
  example using @ref Magnum::TextureTools::atlasArrayPowerOfTwo(). If a certain
  texture needs @ref Magnum::SamplerWrapping::Repeat or
  @relativeref{Magnum::SamplerWrapping,MirroredRepeat}, it has to occupy a
  whole layer, or be a separate texture altogether.
