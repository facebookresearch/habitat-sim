r"""
Simple example showing how to overlap physics and rendering in Habitat-Sim.  The general
pattern is to call sim.start_async_render_and_step_physics instead of sim.step_physics for
the *first* step_physics call and then retrieve observations using sim.get_sensor_observations_async_finish
instead of sim.get_sensor_observations


Known limitations/issues:
    * Creating and destroying simulation instances leaks GPU memory.  On some drivers
    OpenGL leaks GPU memory when the background thread used for rendering is destroyed.
    The workaround is to use sim.close(destroy=False) then sim.reconfigure(new_cfg) instead of
    sim = habitat_sim.Simulator(new_cfg) as this will keep the background thread alive.

    * Segfaults with headed Linux builds.  We've seen this segfault for headed builds.  There
    isn't any reason why the headed Linux build should segfault so we've left it enabled
    under that this is a driver bug and it may work with other driver/OS combinations.

    * Semantic Sensor rendering does not work when there is an RGB mesh and a semantic mesh, like
    in MP3D and Gibson.  When there is a single mesh for RGB and semantics, a semantic sensor works.

    * Sensors that aren't CameraSensors, i.e. FisheyeSensor or EquirectangularSensor, are not
    supported

    * Adding or deleting objects during the async render is not supported.  This will lead to
    an assert checking that the main process owns the OpenGL failing.  You can wait on the
    async render to finish and transfer the context back to the main thread by calling
    sim.renderer.acquire_gl_context().  Note that by default the OpenGL context is transferred
    back to the main thread by calling sim.get_sensor_observations_async_finish() by default.
