  Module.onRuntimeInitialized fields that were defined in habitat_main.js. So it
  needs to execute AFTER habitat_main.js. The defer keyword is needed to enforce
  this. This is because scripts with type="module" such as habitat_main.js are
  implicitly given defer, which causes them to run last. So we need this to be
  deferred as well. -->
