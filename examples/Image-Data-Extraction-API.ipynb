    "* labels: Class labels of the type of images the user wants to extract. Currently we only support extracting images of 'unnavigable points' like walls. In the future we hope to extend this functionality to allow the user to specify more unique class labels, but for now this argument is not that useful.\n",

    "The extractor can be indexed and sliced like a normal python list. Internaly, indexing into the extractor sets an agent position and rotation within the simulator and returns the corresponding agent observation. Indexing returns a dictionary that contains an image of each type specified in the \"output\" argument given by the user in the constructor. The dictionary also contains a key \"label\" which is the class label (specified by the user in the constructor) of the image. Note: for the scene in this example there is no semantic data which is why the semantic output below is not represented."
